Install
-------

The easiest way to install the ccxt library is to use builtin package managers:

-  `ccxt in **NPM** <http://npmjs.com/package/ccxt>`__ (JavaScript / Node v7.6+)
-  `ccxt in **PyPI** <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt>`__ (Python 2 and 3)

This library is shipped as an all-in-one module implementation with minimalistic dependencies and requirements:

-  ```ccxt.js`` <https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/blob/master/ccxt.js>`__ in JavaScript
-  ```./python/`` <https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/blob/master/python/>`__ in Python (generated from JS)
-  ```ccxt.php`` <https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/blob/master/ccxt.php>`__ in PHP (generated from JS)

You can also clone it into your project directory from `ccxt GitHub repository <https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt>`__:

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.git

An alternative way of installing this library into your code is to copy a single file manually into your working directory with language extension appropriate for your environment.

JavaScript (NPM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JavaScript version of ccxt works both in Node and web browsers. Requires ES6 and ``async/await`` syntax support (Node 7.6.0+). When compiling with Webpack and Babel, make sure it is `not excluded <https://github.com/ccxt-dev/ccxt/issues/225#issuecomment-331582275>`__ in your ``babel-loader`` config.

`ccxt crypto trading library in npm <http://npmjs.com/package/ccxt>`__

.. code:: shell

    npm install ccxt

.. code:: javascript

    var ccxt = require ('ccxt')

    console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges

JavaScript (for use with the ``<script>`` tag):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`All-in-one browser bundle <https://unpkg.com/ccxt>`__ (dependencies included), served from `unpkg CDN <https://unpkg.com/>`__, which is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on NPM.

.. code:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/ccxt"></script>

Creates a global ``ccxt`` object:

.. code:: javascript

    console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges

Python
~~~~~~

`ccxt algotrading library in PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt>`__

.. code:: shell

    pip install ccxt

.. code:: python

    import ccxt
    print(ccxt.exchanges) # print a list of all available exchange classes

The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in Python 3.5+

.. code:: python

    import ccxt.async as ccxt # link against the asynchronous version of ccxt

PHP
~~~

The ccxt library in PHP: `**``ccxt.php``** <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kroitor/ccxt/master/ccxt.php>`__

It requires common PHP modules:

-  cURL
-  mbstring (using UTF-8 is highly recommended)
-  PCRE
-  iconv

.. code:: php

    include "ccxt.php";
    var_dump (\cxxt\Exchange::$exchanges); // print a list of all available exchange classes

Proxy
-----

In some specific cases you may want a proxy, if you experience issues with `DDoS protection by Cloudflare <https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/wiki/Manual#ddos-protection-by-cloudflare>`__ or your network / country / IP is rejected by their filters.

If you need a proxy, use the ``proxy`` property (a string literal) containing base URL of http(s) proxy. It is for use with web browsers and from blocked locations.

**Bear in mind that each added intermediary contributes to the overall latency and roundtrip time. Longer delays can result in price slippage.**

The absolute exchange endpoint URL is appended to ``proxy`` string before HTTP request is sent to exchange. The proxy setting is an empty string ``''`` by default. Below are examples of a non-empty proxy string (last slash is mandatory!):

-  ``kraken.proxy = 'https://crossorigin.me/'``
-  ``gdax.proxy   = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/'``

CORS (Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
----------------------------------

CORS is `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>`__. When accessing the HTTP REST API of an exchange from browser with ccxt library you may get a warning or an exception, saying ``No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource``. That means that the exchange admins haven't enabled access to their API from arbitrary web browser pages.

You can still use the ccxt library from your browser via a CORS-proxy, which is very easy to set up or install. There are also public CORS proxies on the internet, like https://crossorigin.me.

To run your own CORS proxy locally you can either set up one of the existing ones or make a quick script of your own, like shown below.

Node.js CORS Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: javascript

    // JavaScript CORS Proxy
    // Save this in a file like cors.js and run with `node cors [port]`
    // It will listen for your requests on the port you pass in command line or port 8080 by default
    let port = (process.argv.length > 2) ? parseInt (process.argv[2]) : 8080; // default
    require ('cors-anywhere').createServer ().listen (port, 'localhost')

Python CORS Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # Python CORS Proxy
    # Save this in a file like cors.py and run with `python cors.py [port]` or `cors [port]`
    try:
        # Python 3
        from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, test as test_orig
        import sys
        def test (*args):
            test_orig (*args, port = int (sys.argv[1]) if len (sys.argv) > 1 else 8080)
    except ImportError: # Python 2
        from BaseHTTPServer import HTTPServer, test
        from SimpleHTTPServer import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

    class CORSRequestHandler (SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
        def end_headers (self):
            self.send_header ('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
            SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.end_headers (self)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        test (CORSRequestHandler, HTTPServer)

Testing CORS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you set it up and run it, you can test it by querying the target URL of exchange endpoint through the proxy (like https://localhost:8080/https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint).

To test the CORS you can do either of the following:

-  set up proxy somewhere in your browser settings, then go to endpoint URL ``https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint``
-  type that URL directly in the address bar as ``https://localhost:8080/https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint``
-  cURL it from command like ``curl https://localhost:8080/https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint``

To let ccxt know of the proxy, you can set the ``proxy`` property on your exchange instance.
