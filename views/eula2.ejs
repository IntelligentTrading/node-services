This End User License Agreement cannot and does not disclose all risks and other aspects involved in holding, trading, or engaging in financing or financed transactions in cryptocurrency. Risks include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p><br></p><p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market Risk: The market for cryptocurrency is still new and uncertain. No one should have funds invested in cryptocurrency or speculate in cryptocurrency that they are not prepared to lose entirely. Whether the market for one or more cryptocurrency will move up or down, or whether a particular cryptocurrency will lose all or substantially all of its value, is unknown. This applies both to traders that are going long and to traders that are shorting the market. Participants should be cautious about holding cryptocurrency.</p><p><br></p><p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidity Risk: Markets for cryptocurrency have varying degrees of liquidity. Some are quite liquid while others may be thinner. Thin markets can amplify volatility. There is never a guarantee that there will be an active market for one to sell, buy, or trade cryptocurrency or products derived from or ancillary to them.</p><p><br></p><p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Risk: The legal status of certain cryptocurrency may be uncertain. This can mean that the legality of holding or trading them is not always clear. Whether and how one or more cryptocurrency constitute property, or assets, or rights of any kind may also seem unclear. Participants are responsible for knowing and understanding how cryptocurrency will be addressed, regulated, and taxed under applicable law.</p><p><br></p><p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange Risk (Counterparty Risk): Having cryptocurrency on deposit or with any third-party in a custodial relationship has attendant risks. These risks include security breaches, risk of contractual breach, and risk of loss. Participants should be wary of allowing third-parties to hold their property for any reason.</p><p><br></p><p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading Risk: In addition to liquidity risks, values in any digital token marketplace are volatile and can shift quickly. Participants in any cryptocurrency market are warned that they should pay close attention to their position and holdings, and how they may be impacted by sudden and adverse shifts in trading and other market activities.</p><p><br></p><p>USER EXPLICITLY AGREES THAT IT ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY AND THE USE OF ITF’S SOFTWARE, PLATFORM, BOT(S), SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND/OR WEBSITE(S).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnification</strong>&nbsp;User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ITF and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, service providers, successors, and assigns from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from or relating to User’s use or misuse of the Software, Platform, Bot(s), Services, Products, or Website(s), or User’s breach of this Agreement.

With respect to disputes not properly subject to binding arbitration as set forth below in ARTICLE IV Section 6, the Parties hereby exclusively and irrevocably submit to, and waive any objection against, the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the Republic of Mauritius.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disputes</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding Arbitration. Any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any alleged breach of this Agreement, the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement (including the validity, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration provision and associated “questions of arbitrability”), or the relationship between the Parties (including such Parties’ members, managers, partners, shareholders, employees, officers, directors, and affiliates) under this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, that cannot be resolved among the Parties, will be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“ICDR”) in Singapore, but where any international Parties shall be allowed to participate in any arbitration via teleconference or videoconference, before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the ICDR. Arbitration in accordance with the foregoing will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of such disputes.</p><p>The arbitrator may grant injunctive relief, including temporary, preliminary, permanent, and mandatory injunctive relief, in order to protect the rights of each Party, but will not be limited to such relief. This provision for arbitration will not preclude a Party from seeking temporary or preliminary injunctive relief (“Provisional Relief”) in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending in order to protect its rights pending a final determination by the arbitrator, nor will the filing of such an action for Provisional Relief constitute waiver by a Party of its right to seek arbitration. Any Provisional Relief granted by such court will remain effective until otherwise modified by the arbitrator.</p><p>Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any and all remedies provided by applicable law; provided, that it is expressly agreed that the arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, ITF and the User now waiving their right, if any, to recover punitive or exemplary damages, either in arbitration or in litigation (and the Parties specifically agree that any dispute as to whether a Party may obtain meaningful relief for allegations of statutory violations in an arbitration forum will be resolved by arbitration as provided in this Section). ITF and the User specifically waive the right to seek or obtain damages for noneconomic loss or injury or for derivative economic loss or injury.</p><p>At the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator will issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s award or decision is based. Any award or relief granted by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the Parties to this Agreement, may be entered as a judgment or order in any court of competent jurisdiction, and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><br></p><p>The arbitrator will award to the prevailing Party in any such arbitration such Party’s reasonable Fees and Costs incurred by it in connection with resolution of the dispute, in addition to any other relief granted. For these purposes, “Fees and Costs” includes: (i) reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, other legal fees and costs, the fees and costs of witnesses, accountants, experts, and other professionals, and other forum costs incurred in the arbitration; (ii) all of the foregoing whether incurred before or after the initiation of arbitration; and (iii) all such fees and costs incurred in obtaining Provisional Relief. It is understood that certain time entries that may appear in the billing records of such Party’s legal counsel may be redacted to protect attorney-client or work-product privilege, and this will not prevent recovery for the associated billings (and if necessary, the arbitrator may require that such records be submitted to the arbitrator for in camera review by the arbitrator).</p><h3 id=""><br></h3><p>THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST THE OTHER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneys’ Fees. Should any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding be commenced between the Parties concerning the rights or obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, the Party prevailing in such proceeding shall be entitled, in addition to such other relief as may be granted, to a reasonable sum as and for its attorneys’ fees in such proceeding. This amount shall be determined by the court in such proceeding or in a separate action brought for that purpose. In addition to any amount received as attorneys’ fees, the prevailing Party also shall be entitled to receive from the Party held to be liable an amount equal to the attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in enforcing any judgment against such Party. This Section is severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and survives any judgment and is not deemed merged into any judgment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severability.</strong>&nbsp;If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired and shall remain in full force and effect.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headings.</strong>&nbsp;Headings used herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not in any way affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.</p></div><div class="ql-clipboard" contenteditable="true" tabindex="-1" style="top: 46px;"></div><div id="_tl_link_tooltip" class="tl_link_tooltip"></div><div id="_tl_tooltip" class="tl_tooltip" data-hover="_italic_button" style="left: -28px; top: 22738px;">
